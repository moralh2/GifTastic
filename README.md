# GifTastic
HW 6 - GifTastic 
AJAX was used in this assignment to leverage the Giphy API to load gifs into the DOM at the request of the user. The theme chosen was 'emotions', since it yields a good mix of different gifs. When the page first loads, buttons appear, each with an emotion; clicking one of these triggers an AJAX request for 10 gifs for the associated word, which are then loaded on the page. The click also triggers a load-more button to appear; this button triggers additional requests to load 10 new gifs. Buttons to collapse each 10-gif set were added to improve the UI when too many gifs have been loaded on the page. Also, within the description at the top of the page, there is a form for the user to input a new word in order to create a new button; if the word exists, the button is not created. The new button gets added to the gif-buttons section and has the same functionality as the rest (gif request for that keyword).
