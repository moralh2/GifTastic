# GifTastic
HW 6 - GifTastic 

AJAX was used in this assignment to leverage the Giphy API. The theme chosen was 'emotions', since it yields a good mix of different GIFs. When the page first loads, buttons appear, each with an emotion; clicking one of these triggers an AJAX request for 10 GIFs for the associated word, which are then loaded on the page. The click also triggers a load-more button to appear; this button triggers additional requests to load 10 new ones. Buttons to collapse each 10-GIF set were added to improve the UI when too many have been loaded on to the page. Also, within the description at the top of the page, there is a form for the user to input a new word in order to create a new button; if the word exists, the button is not created. The new button gets added to the gif-buttons section and has the same functionality as the rest (AJAX request for that keyword).
